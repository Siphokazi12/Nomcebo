        Dear Nomcebo Thwala, 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another trip around the sun, and look at you! You made it through, stronger, wiser, and even more radiant. That’s no small thing. Being here, being you, and still going, that is an accomplishment worth celebrating.
      </p>

      <p>
This time last year, we were knee-deep in stress, overwhelmed and wondering how we’d get through it all. But guess what? You did it. You always do. Through  every doubt, every moment of exhaustion you kept going. That’s the kind of strength that can’t be taught. It lives in you. And that’s why I know, no matter what life throws your way, you’ll rise. You always rise.
      </p>

      <p>
        God’s timing is perfect, and even when the path feels unclear, I know He’s aligning everything for your good. So please, don’t stop. Keep going. Keep trusting. Keep praying. The blessings ahead are going to make so much sense, and you’ll look back in awe of what He had planned all along.

      </p>

      <p>
        You light up rooms with your energy, inspire everyone around you with your work ethic, and make even the toughest days feel bearable just by being you. The world is better because you’re in it and my world is brighter because I have you in my life.

      </p>
      <p>
      I’m beyond grateful for my Nomcebo. Everyone needs someone like you. Just… not my Nomcebo. 
    </p>

      <p>
        Here’s to more growth, more joy, more answered prayers, and more reasons to celebrate you. You deserve all of it and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Love you big time.
      </p>

      <p>
        HBD ke ntobo… hope it’s nothing but the best. 
      </p>

        Love Siphokazi
